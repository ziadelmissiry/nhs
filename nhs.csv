The below shows snippets of PBI and SSRS that differs considerably from locally captured information where we are assured the referrals have been recorded onto RiO.



I have summarised below the year to date referral discrepancies across PowerBI, SSRS and the local records for the reporting period:



February 2023- December 2023:



YTD referrals on PowerBi for the Barnet Triage Team = 1448

YTD referrals on SSRS for the Barnet Triage Team = 1565

YTD referrals based on local records held for Barnet Triage Team = 2049



As a matter of Priority – please can we request All referrals opened to ‘Barnet Adults Triage’ team for period Jan-23 – Dec 23, regardless of if the referral was transferred onto another team.



Please investigate and confirm if a new referral is created to the ‘Barnet Adults Triage’ Team and then transferred on to another team is it counted under PBI referrals report?",,,,,,Urgent,,,On hold,Anuja,Operations,Moved to slow burner on 10/06/24,-32365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every year since 2017 when the service launched, the Perinatal Service produces a yearly outcome report on excel spreadsheet. Nikitha Niranjana has supported us with this for the past 3 years as her role has been funded by the perinatal budget. She has a good understanding of what is required in this report.

Dear Nikitha/Colleague from data team
Please can I request the end of year Perinatal outcome report be completed for 2023-24 (SPMHS & Maple) with couple of additions this year regarding health inequalities
Please add in information for Referrals; (per borough if possible)
•	Ethnicity
•	Postcode determiners (to identify proportion of referrals which have come from areas of social deprivation)
Also, could we add in information collated from the Core 10 so we can have some data showing clinical progress through time in service, showing scores at entry and exit to the team.

It would be helpful to meet to discuss these new additions as well as layout of this year’s report as we do every year.

?

Following a meeting yesterday between Community Service Line leads for NCL and Health in Justice Liaison and Diversion (police and courts) management, an agreement has been reached for the borough’s of Barnet, Enfield, Haringey, Camden and Islington to provide a 1 year data sample to Liaison and Diversion management for the following:

?

i. L&D services are requesting data on all referrals from the criminal justice pathway whom were not considered eligible for secondary care services post assessment. These cases can also be considered to be those who were referred but did not attend appointments with community mental health services.

?

ii. The data sample request is from 01.04.23 – 01.04.24.

?

iii. We understand that when referencing the referral from the criminal justice pathway it is likely to be identified as police liaison team although our service also includes both crown and magistrates court diversion services which may also come up on the system.

?

iv. The intention of the request is to identify the numbers of cases that have gone through criminal justice services and been declined adult community mental health services (for a number of different reasons). This would then identify a cohort of service users whom would fall into a ‘gap’. The L&D services are now under a formal review by NHSE with the intention to consider how such a cohort can be better supported hence the request for the data on this group.",North London Partnership,Meeting to be held on 01/05/24,,,,31/07/2024, ,Routine,,04/07/2024,Complete,Anuja & NIkitha,Community,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
